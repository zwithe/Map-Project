# Map-Project
The map is fetched from leaflet's api and the businesses are gotten from foursquare's api.
The map places markers on up to five nearby Businesses based on the user's location acoording to the selected dropdown option.
The only the pins for the selected business type are dispalyed. Took way more work to do that than expected.
When testing locally uncomment out line 72 of js and comment out line 73.
